							<p>It is to be expected in today's professional world that everyone needs to be a leader, a communicator, and a team player irrespective of the role within the company or business they form a part of. This is reinforced by Burning Glass research which shows in the top general skills required by employers these skills and others are critical to landing the job that you are after. As such our team must endeavor to gain and improve most if not all, of the top 30 most required general skills. </p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h1>Individual contibutions.</h1>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Cameron Aitken</h4>
								<p>My Ideal job is a long-term goal not only being technical but also a managerial position requiring many of the most sought-after skills in the general skill category and more than a few in the technical category. Moreover, in the process of working towards such a position I would first have to gain the qualifications and learn the technical component of the job in more depth prior to moving into the lead role where the leadership and management aspects of the job would become the focus.</p>
								<p>And taking the industry data into consideration the IT specific skills will be most important in my journey towards the lead role more so than in the role itself so in a way I will require some of the most sought after IT specific skills on my journey.</p>
								<p>Being a management role much if not all the general skills will be required to successfully take on a leading role meaning I would need to work on and develop the most sought-after general skills to be competitive in this role.</p>
								<p>The role itself does not require more than a basic understanding of the top three IT skills SQL, JAVA and Java script but as stated being a role which requires experience in these areas before moving into the lead role. It will be beneficial to find an interim role which does require these skills. </p>
								<p>The general skills that will be missing look to be research and QA however I believe the role will involve overseeing members who do undertake these tasks.</p>
								<p>My Ideal job is no longer specifically this job it is now more broadly any IT management role as I enjoy running teams and having a high-level understanding of all the specifics in my field as opposed to specializing with a deep understanding of just one thing. </p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Jack Northway</h4>
								<p>After viewing the Burning Glass Data from 2018, the most requested skill sets that are required in the industry are Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Organizational Skills and Writing. Which in my opinion isn't necessarily limited to just the IT (Information Technology) Industry. It is sought after in all industries. With Poor Communication Skills and Organizational skills, it would be undesirable to employee you.</p>
								<p>I would need to work on my communication skills, as I tend to fumble up what I am trying to say and go in roundabout ways of doing so. Working 5 years in the construction industry, the other skills in demand are something I do on a day-to-day basis </p>
								<p>The highest IT specific skill sets that are in high demand are SQL, Java-Script, Java, Microsoft Windows.</p>
								<p>I personally only have the skill of using Microsoft Windows, as it is the operating system that I have grown up with to use. SQL, Java-Script, and Java are still foreign to me, hopefully after continuing to do this Degree, it would introduce me to those Languages, and I can become skilled in them.</p>
								<p>As for the career I choose for Assessment 1, I might start looking at other options. As I am still not sure what I am looking for as a career in IT. The Software Engineer job I chose was simply because I needed to choose a career and I like Google as a company. </p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Jack Bell</h4>
								<p>After viewing the burning glass data, March 2018 Top generic skills, communication skills is the most regarded skill which I believe most of our team’s roles require, my role “signals officer” has form my understanding communication as the top skill followed by interpersonal skills. and in “top skills” document has these skills as communication as 1st followed by problem solving then organization skills 4th being which most of our team's roles have a required skill for.</p>
								<p>My skill set is in line with this document because I possess the following skills, communication skills being the highest sort after skill, followed by interpersonal skills then, problem solving they the most required skill sets needed for my ideal role.</p>
								<p>In the document the 6th desirable skill is troubleshooting were as for my role if something does not work because it is broken, I would send it to someone else to fix it, so from my understanding troubleshooting may not be a necessary skill.</p>
								<p>The 4th highest ranked and required skill for my role is writing, I do not consider myself a good writer going forward with roles in the IT industry I would have to work on this skill.</p>
								<p>After viewing the burning glass data, my original ideal role has not changed because my skills currently Aline with the role requirements and the added benefit of learning a variety of extra skills as well as career prospects including the ability to switch to a part time version on the role, if I were to find a different better suited role, these factors incline me to stay with my ideal role.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Thomas Jermeiah</h4>
								<p>Based on the Burning Glass Technologies reference data, the top 3 ranked skill sets are database (SQL) and platform independent programming languages (browser based – JavaScript & cross platform – Java). These suggest the industry trend towards online, cloud based, platform agnostic services. My ideal job from assignment 1 aligns well with this trend.</p>
								<p>As the IT environment has expanded further into the professional world, becoming inextricably embedded in almost all facets of modern business, the ability for the IT professional to be able to effectively communicate has become essential. This is borne out by the data, suggesting communications skills are the most valuable, at almost three times the second ranked skill of problem solving. The ability to convey and translate concepts and needs across a variety of stakeholders is valuable in any profession, and further developing these will pay dividends regardless of my future career path.</p>
								<p>The role I chose for my ideal job as part of Assignment 1 did not require expertise with several the middle ranked specific skill listed in the Burning Glass Data. That said, integrating with existing business processes, by providing SAP compatibility or other legacy software is likely to increase the value of any development I may be part of. There was also no direct expectation of proficiency with business management of analysis, however these skills may become more valuable as I advance my career and take on roles where consideration of the needs of the business become important.</p>
								<p>As the roles I considered were entry level, the expectation for Leadership skills, Quality Assurance and Time Management was low. The skills will increase in relevance as I progress through my career, taking on more senior positions.</p>
								<p>After reviewing the Burning Glass Data, I would still pursue the career path I originally chose. While there are specific skills which I may have less opportunity to develop, I will have an opportunity to gain a broad spectrum of valuable skills, either through direct use (SQL, JavaScript, etc.) or indirectly through exposure to the professional environment (Business Management & Analysis, Building Relationships, etc.).</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Joshua Douglas</h4>
								<p>The IT-Specific skills in my required skillset cover the entire range of referenced data from most in demand to least in demand. When removing the more generalized skills such as Microsoft windows and communications, the skill set required tends to fit into the lower end of the rankings of in demand skills according to the burning glass data.</p>

								<p>The general skills in my required skill set also cover the broad range of referenced skills in the burning glass data. The top 2 most in demand skills are in my required skill sets with the largest range of required skills filling out a small majority of the top 10 required skills. </p>

								<p> The three highest ranked IT-specific skills that are not required in my skill set are SQL, Java script and JAVA. These skills are the top 3 ranked skills according to the burning glass data as of the year 2018.</p>

								<p>The three highest ranked general skills that are not in my required skillset are Organizational Skills, Teamwork, and planning. These skills are all ranked 3rd, 5th, and 7th respectively according to the burning glass data as of the year 2018.</p>

								<p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. My interest in programming was not based on what was most in demand in terms of role or positions, but instead based upon my general interest in coding as a whole and the applications of languages like C++. </p>
