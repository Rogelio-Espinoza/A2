<p class=MsoNormal>Cyber security must cover all 7 layers of the <a
name="_Int_LpSVwIod">OSI (Overall Satisfaction Index)</a> framework (Check
Point, 2022), while also ensuring and educating the users of such systems to have
due diligence regarding credentials, as if they become compromised then the
system will be put at risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cyber security industry that employs approximately 1
million people worldwide and ~30000 in Australia <span lang=EN-AU>(Cisco-Portal.Com
Team, 2021).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><strong><span lang=EN-AU style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;
font-weight:normal'>Recent cyber security attacks are <a name="_Int_JZd3rWJB">a</a>
mixture of social engineering and abuse of known exploits in systems such as email
phishing attacks from black hat hackers. These attacks threaten targets with
damage to their computers or dispersal of their personal information if the
demands are not complied with (Sujata, 2021).</span></strong></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On offensive cyber security:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The state of the art in cyber security is Machine Learning (Kirandeep
Kaur, 2021). This could be used to bypass and dismantle cyber-security systems
faster than most prevention methods and detection tools can keep up with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU>On defensive cyber security:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One method of system defense is by comparing predictive
logic against behavioral signals from an external source that suggests a
threat. Machine learning algorithms are being employed to discover harmful
network traffic. They are called Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) (Check
Point, 2022). �</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, in cyber security, the best way to secure
information stored on a digital device is to ensure that network infrastructure
is correctly configured, physically secured, and users are educated on the
potential risks and permissions/passwords are correctly assigned (<span
lang=EN-AU>Bradly M, 2021</span>).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When configuring devices use a strong password and change the
default settings. It is also essential to avoid outdated and insecure protocols
such as telnet and WPA within sensitive environments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Physical security is ensuring that network devices and infrastructure
are behind locked doors and that only authorized users are granted access with
passwords.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another major exposure point for IT environments is the
users themselves. As security breaches have increased in frequency and
consequence, industry has put in place many measures to mitigate the risks. As
back-end security has improved, malicious actors have moved their attention to
the most vulnerable component in any system, the users. All administrative
controls have one major flaw, the need for human access. In a 2016 study, 93%
of data breaches were attributed to human error (Evans. M et al pg .3 table. 1
[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/sec.1657]). It is therefore
essential that users are educated on attacks they may encounter and given the
training and tools to identify and avoid threats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Access to the WIFI password should be restricted to so that
is not common knowledge in the office/workplace and only the network
administrator/authorized personnel know the WIFI password so that someone cannot
ask anyone for the password and gain admin access to the whole network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:107%;color:black;
background:white'>In the Australian defence force, they use a cloud-based wide
area network (WAN) network that is secured to exchange secret information
(Microsoft News Center,2020) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='color:black;background:white'>Going
forward in cyber security, nations are now performing cyber-attacks against other
nations, in acts of aggression or war which can also be called a new military
strategy as it is the fifth dimension of war. (Donghui, 2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='color:black;background:white'>Cyber-attacks
are becoming commonplace, such as what happened in Ukraine and Russia in 2022 before
war broke out a cyber-attack was performed to cripple Ukraine�s economy and military
(</span><span lang=EN-AU>James Pearson,2022)<span style='color:black;
background:white'>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='color:black;background:white'>North
Korea frequently performs cyber-attacks against South Korea as a clandestine
military strategy (Donghui, 2016).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on these developments Cyber security attacks by a
rouge actor will soon be able to perform fast, easy effective attacks against
computer systems on small mobile devices as depicted in the game series Watchdogs
(Jill Scharr, 2014).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the game, a city-wide operating system �ctOS� operates
many electronic devices such as <a name="_Int_qqbV9tjD">ATM (Air Traffic
Management)</a>, Traffic lights, and security cameras, and stores the residents
personal information such as bank cards, address, age, and occupation, creating
a large network containing sensitive personal information, the protagonist(Aiden)
an individual who breached/hacked the ctOS system this allows him to alter the
networks devices, traffic lights, for example, to change while in a high-speed
chase with authorities and being able to walk up to any ATM in the city and
withdraw money at a victim/NPC expense (Jill Scharr, 2014).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These developments could enable completely automated
cyber-attacks without the need to have a person actively carrying out the
attack. Instead by defining the intended outcome, attacks may be conducted
through automated processes which enables fast and easy cyber-attacks for
people with minimal computer knowledge. This would be possible through machine
learning and clever application with a streamlined approach (Jill Scharr,
2014).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An example of the above is an extremely small brute-forcing
device to attack a WIFI password and crack within seconds by imputing the
network SSID, you can achieve this by using quantum computers which have extreme
computational power far more than systems which use standard binary language
binary computers thus cracking hashed passwords in seconds (McElhearn, 2020).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon, quantum computers and their applications regarding their
computational power will make many current protocols obsolete, and methods of encryption
a large part of cyber security to also become obsolete, foundations of network
working such as the OSI layers will <a name="_Int_vsxYr7wg">need</a> to be
completely reworked (NIST, 2016).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if quantum computing technology does not become
available, current manufacturing technologies are likely to improve, increasing
computational capacity and resulting in the same outcomes (<span lang=EN-AU
style='color:#333333;background:white'>Lawrence Berkeley, 2014)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon with <a name="_Int_bYdiAIV9">AI (Artificial
Intelligence)</a> technology there will be a potential for AI technology to
replace radio operators with Artificially intelligent Radio operators. These would
be vastly superior to the human type much like the way self-driving cars
theoretically would be safer than human drivers due to computers never losing
focus (Techopedia, 2022). This is important to consider in the context of cyber
security as computers can be hacked, unlike humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What is the impact development? What is likely to change?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The potential impact of easy-to-use small mobile devices for
cyber-attacks creates the need for new systems and applications to be able to
deal with the unique threats they present. This in turn would cause a significant
need for security experts and designers to update security protocols and
encryption algorithms to ensure that cyber security can be maintained, also
being able to function unimpeded by a new age of hackers and security risks (<span
lang=EN-AU style='color:black;background:white'>Norwich University, 2021)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the next 3 years <span lang=EN-AU style='color:black;
background:white'>the use of the cloud and its many potential applications and
risks to cyber security, experts will have to figure out and <a
name="_Int_Za1ERpzi">produce</a> new methods to allow for cyber security to be maintained
(Zainab Al Mehdar, 2018). Cloud-based storage such as Drobox and Google Drive, cloud-based
networks and other similar technologies are used by most companies to store
sensitive information. As cloud technologies become more deeply integrated into
personal life and business operations, there will be a greater necessity to
develop secure in this domain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developments with communication and data transmission
technologies could potentially affect the way radio communications are
conducted in the Australian Defense Force (ADF). Signals could go from command
post to command post creating a network, to an extremely developed command post
with extremely powerful signal equipment in Canberra, combine that with AI
radio operators you have changed an entire core in the military. (Jill Scharr,
2014).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='color:black;background:white'>The
above developments will change the demands of cyber security, network administrators,
data entry workers, and office workers, all jobs where people who work with a
network worth securing from cyber-attacks is necessary due to sensitive
information that is stored on the network. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-AU style='line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How will this affect you and your family or your friends
in your daily life?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my daily life cyber security matters to me because I use
a computer for many functions in my current jobs (computer Technicon, personal
trainer, UNI student) such as sending invoices and storage of information that
is sensitive, being able to save UNI work for later and build off previous
saves. This would enable me to fix something after being submitted because I
have a copy of this report, for example, if I had a security breach say all my
files got deleted then I would have serious work output issues, having to do
this whole report again and lose all or a lot of retained information, that is
not externally backed up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cyber security as an industry also affects my job prospects
because I am looking to gain employment in cyber security via UNI studies and
my cert 4 in cyber security if something big happened in cyber security such as
a ground-breaking invention, then I would have to be familiar with this <a
name="_Int_lCkFaPIo">modern technology</a> such as quantum computers making
WPA2 networks obsolete (NIST, 2016).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cyber security affects family members as well because they
store memories in the form of digital photos on a cloud or local device. Family
members may also store personal information such as copies of birth
certificates, driver�s <a name="_Int_KH8EKjOD">licenses,</a> or other sensitive
personal information which if in the wrong hands can be used for identity theft
(<span lang=EN-AU>Sujata, 2021)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cyber security also affects a company�s reputation, the
April 2021 Facebook had a breach where users� birthdates, phone numbers, and passwords
were leaked by hackers, exposing personal <a name="_Int_RWvBaLkt">information,</a>
and causing people to distrust Facebook changing some people�s behaviors about
what they share when using Facebook (Kate O'Flaherty, 2021).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In conclusion, as technologies advance, people and organizations
will experience new means of cyber-attacks, and previous methods of securing networks
will increasingly become obsolete, requiring cyber security experts to develop
new tools and methods of securing information and technology.<span lang=EN-AU><br
