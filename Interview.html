								<h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
								<p>To enable our team to better understand what it is like to work within the information technology (IT) industry, I was able to interview Evan, the Senior IT Engineer with a global mining technology company.</p>
								<p>We discussed his many years of experience, from beginning his professional career supporting a company with network management though numerous roles where has been responsible for help desk, network administration, infrastructure management and application solutions.</p>
								<p>Within his current role which he has held since February 2022, Evan oversees all areas of the production environment. He fulfills the role of IT manager with responsibilities for ensuring the entire IT ecosystem is secure and stable, which includes researching, selecting, and implementing any software and applications required to meet these targets.</p>
								<p>His user base spans many small offices spread throughout the globe, including Australia, Chile, South Africa, Russia, and Ukraine.</p>
								<p>Evan described a career spanning many years, during which technology has changed significantly. His insight into the current IT landscape and the future of the industry will prove valuable as our team continue our studies and enter the field.</p>

								<h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h3>
								<p>As the most senior member of the IT department, Evan interacts with all levels of the company. He provides end user support through the help desk, interacts with management advising them on his area of expertise and acts as the contact point for vendors of software and applications required to effectively fulfill his role.</p>
								<p>The business has a strong focus on research and development, specialising in automation and smart technologies for the industrial mining sector. This requires him to work directly with development engineers building and testing products which operate within the information technology sphere. </p>
								<p>Working within a small team which interacts with a variety of disciplines, Evan presents an aptitude for communicating effectively with all levels, from end users to corporate management.</p>

								<h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
								<p>Evan described his major focus since entering the role as working to move the company to a structured and managed corporate IT environment across the global business. As the business possessed strong capabilities with a range of IT skills through the research and development engineers, there was previously no formal corporate IT position. This presented several challenges with ensuring a reliable IT environment. Since coming onboard, Evan has focused on taking ownership of production IT systems, allowing the research and development department to focus on its core function.</p>
								<p>Recently the company was subject to an audit as part of receiving cyber assurance certification. As a result of this audit, Evan has been working to roll out modern security policies across a variety of corporate platforms. He implemented two factor authentication across HR, payroll, and other platforms, including VPN services.</p>
								<p>He has also been working to move production systems out of development environments to ensure an adequate level of stability and redundancy is provided. He noted the company had recently encountered an issue where a piece of hardware had failed and there was no redundancy process, this failure had a significant financial and production impact.</p>

								<h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
								<p>I discussed with Evan the challenges he faced as part of his daily tasks. He mentioned that trouble shooting issues with systems, networks and software was a core function of his role and one he genuinely enjoyed.</p>
								<p>Evan described difficulties with effective management of change due to the small relative size of the company. Prior to him taking up the position, changes were undertaken in an ad hoc manner, with limited controls and without advising end users of possible disruptions to services. Evan noted that although he is currently unable to implement a formal management of change process, all planned events are now communicated to affected users prior to being undertaken.</p>
								<p>He is also implementing policies and processes which impact the existing culture of the business. Previously, each office acted independently with regards to device procurement and management, and there was little control over the devices once issued to users. Under Evans direction, the business has moved to configuring new devices using Windows Autopilot (Overview of Windows Autopilot | Microsoft Docs) and manage those devices with Microsoft Intune (Microsoft Intune). He has also begun restricting the installation of applications by users with policies in the device endpoint software.</p>
								<p>When questioned about his experience interacting with users who had previously had little oversight, he noted most users were very accepting as they understood poor culture and practices exposed the company to unacceptable risks. </p>
								<p>Another challenge Evan mentioned is communicating with teams spread throughout the world. The time zone differences mean he is required to work outside of local business hours at times to participate in live discussions with employees situated in distant countries. </p>
								<P>Evanâ€™s passion for solving issues was evident throughout our discussion as he spoke of the value of effective troubleshooting, and how the ability to identify and rectify issues utilizing experience, reasoning and critical thinking were essential in IT support roles.</P>
