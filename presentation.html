									Water cannot live without it. 

										<br><br>Drinking Water comes from many sources, such as Rivers, Lakes, Tanks and of course your kitchen tap  
										
										<br><br>On an average day, an average person will drink an average amount of 2 and a half liters of water.  
										
										 
										
										<br><br>Some people drink more. 
										
										 
								
										
										<br><br>According to the World Health Organization 2 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water. These water sources are contaminated with poo, bathing people, dirty wash and dead animals. 
										
										<br><br>Drinking these water sources are linked to Transmission of diseases such as Diarrhea, Hepatitis A, Typhoid and Polio. 
										
										<br><br>An estimate of 1 million people die each year from Diarrhea as a result of unsafe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene. 
										
										 
			
										<br><br>In Australia we are lucky to have safe drinking water from town mains, It's something we take for granted. 
										
										<br><br>But for Individuals in rural areas, they may not have access to town mains, and have to relie on Rainwater, which is stored in Water Tanks. 
										
										<br><br>Tank water is generally  safe to Drink, there are times where the water quality demissisions quickly. 
										
										<br><br>Bird and Animal droppings on the Roof of a house can make its way into the WaterTank 
										
										<br><br>I've seen Dead possums, lizards' birds inside water tanks. 
										
										<br><br>These contaminations can cause harmful microorganisms, such as Bactria and Parasite 
										
			
										
										<br><br>With that we came up with the idea of a Water Tank Sampler, a device that attaches inline and gives the user a quick reading to decide if the water source is safe enough to drink. It doesnâ€™t clean the tank for you but does give a reference to determine if the water is still safe to drink 
										

										<br><br>The  device  attaches inline on the water tanks outlet. It senses, PH Levels, Electrical Conductivity, Temperature, and a camera to find water soluble. Is the device of the future, to help determine if the Tank water source is safe to drink. And that the parameters have not changed. 
										
										<br><br>The device uses a a simple traffic light system, helps you quickly determine if the Tank water is still safe to drink. 
										
										<br><br>The device also has a web interface to see the Status of all the sensors to get a more in-depth readout.  
										
										<br><br>In the future a history log will be implemented to see the change of the water over time. 
										
										 
										
										<br><br>The device is simple, all you need to do is connect the device inline of the water source and find a reliable power source to power the electronics, a simple battery and solar panel setup will be sufficed. 
										
										<br><br>Connecting the device to the internet is also simple, follow the basic instructions that will be supplied with the device to connect it to the Internet. 
										
										 
										
										<br><br>Here we are going to talk to the men who developed the Software and Interface to discuss the Operation of the Device and the software behind it. 

										<br><br>Thanks, Josh, for the run down on the user interface. 

										<br><br>This concludes Team Charlies Project: The Water Tank Sampler.
