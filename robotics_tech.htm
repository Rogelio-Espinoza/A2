<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>What does it do? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Robotic technologies also known as
mechatronics is the combination of Artificial Intelligence and mechanics to
create autonomous machines that can fulfill a role or specific sub-function. A
robot is defined as being <span style='color:#1A1A1A;background:white'>an
intelligent, physically embodied machine capable of performing tasks
autonomously to some degree while also being able to sense and manipulate its
environment. </span><span style='color:#1A1A1A'>(Simon, 2020)</span> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Our use of robots in society has become
widespread amongst many facets of industry, manufacturing, agriculture, commercial
enterprise, in the home, and even in space exploration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>(Dimock, 2020) (NASA, 2022) (Rawat, 2022) For
example modern car manufacturing production lines(Simon, 2020) utilize robotic
arms for lifting, drilling cutting, welding as well as assembly. In addition to
this CNC machines have allow for the mass production of components greatly
improving the speed at which manufacturing takes place. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The automotive industry has also made
advancements in vehicle safety with the use of robotics. It has achieved this
by utilizing systems such as ABS (Anti-Lock Braking Systems) which detects when
the wheels are turning faster and adjusts the rate of braking along with other
systems such as lane assist and collision detection and airbags. Future
technology is also moving towards self-driving cars, which take away the human
error with the goal of making roads safer and less congested. (Dimock, 2020)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In the home robotic technologies have been
developed to assist with everyday domestic tasks such as Roombas, baby monitors,
smart wiring and  Intelligent washing machines which can detect how much water
is needed for a given load and then send you a SMS alert when it's time to
change the load. As well as host of other recreational devices. (Dimock, 2020)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Many advancements in robotics have been made
in the field of space exploration since its inception in 1958, (whyweexplore)
one of which is NASA’s (North Atlantic Space Association) Curiosity A Rover
which is capable of autonomous movement, operation as it collects samples and
data and analyses the raw material as data to send back to earth for scientists
for further analyses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Robots such as the humanoid-like Sophia, have
also been developed, that can learn from and adapt from interactions with
people. (Dimock, 2020) Sophia is capable of operating similar to how a human
would function, with her ability to control a working mouth and limbs by
sending power to various motors in her body mimicking a human nervous system.
The robotics company SynTouch (Simon, 2020) has also made major developments in
the field by creating robotic fingers for prosthetics and robots similar to
Sophia. These fingers are capable of detecting a range of sensations from
temperature to coarseness. This development adds a new dimension to how robots can
interact with the wider world and improves the quality of life for those using
robotic prosthetics. These prosthetics have also undergone developments to
utilize sensors attached to muscles in the arm to allow the wearer of the
prosthetic to be able to move the fingers like a second hand improving the
quality of life for those with prosthetics. (Dimock, April 2020)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One amazing development being made in the robotics
domain is the introduction of the Consis Robotic Cabinet (Rus, 2022), an
automated shelf in pharmacies that can stock and dispense products. Robots like
this can automate the shelf stocking of supermarkets down the line and fully
automate the shopping experience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Future and near future advancements in
robotics technology will allow for hardware to be miniaturized, improving
affordability and accessibility to a broader market. Modularization would allow
for engineers to create self-contained components compatible with a standard
framework, allowing customization to meet the specific needs of the owner. Autonomous
Devices describe robots that can examine their environment and making changes
on the fly to be able to adapt and regulate themselves to maintain peak
performance. <span style='color:black'>(ECPI University, 2022)</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>To summarize, robotics has been utilized to
advance most aspects of society. It has potential to improve the automation,
efficiency and safety in most sectors.  Robots are also  designed with human
senses in mind. Robotic technology is the automation of previously impossible,
dangerous or mundane tasks, with the goal to create a more efficient and
practical society. The technology used also helps to raise the quality of life
in households by making mundane tasks more efficient, and also speed the
production and expansion of industries. The technology also enables scientific
fields to spread beyond the scope of what is currently possible. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>What is the likely impact? </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The primary impact of advancements in the
field of robotics is efficiency through automation. Robotics can allow society
to do more things with far less effort and time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Robots have the potential to increase
efficiency in building sites and manufacturing facilities.  Replacing labor
intensive projects with automated systems using robotics, increasing output and
reducing risk. This improves safety for workers by reducing manual handling and
risks associated with accessing dangerous environments. On the whole, replacing
humans with robots and robotics in high risk scenarios will significantly
improve safety outcomes in these industries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>(DJ Wardynski, 2020)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The impacts of robotics on the field of
science and discovery, allows scientists to explore previously inaccessible
locations such as the deep ocean and outer-space where environmental conditions
prevent traditional methods of exploration. (Peter, 2013)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Robotics, in general, can also meaningfully
improve day-to-day life, with a broad range of tasks being completed by devices
designed specifically for the application. These tasks may be highly complex, with
self-driving cars an example of a complex and dynamic. These advancements can
drastically improve the general quality of life for society by reducing the
time spent on menial tasks, allowing for greater productivity and additional
recreation time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:yellow'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Int_JrewFRqH"><span lang=EN>However there is a
major moral dilemma associated with robotics and the automation of our future.</span></a><span
lang=EN> There is a potential for a robot to make decisions based on its
programming that can lead to highly unethical or even potentially fatal
decisions. This development is doubly problematic when it's considered that the
logic is often cold and not influenced by other more human factors such as
empathy and human emotion. The risk of this issue is compounded when using
robotics in warfare, specifically robotics coupled with artificial
intelligence. In the battlespace decisions need to be made quickly, with rapid
acquisition of new information there is a potential for cold logic to make
catastrophic choices given that it is unable to take context or nuance into
consideration this could lead to the mass loss of human life. (DJ Wardynski,
2020) (Kenna Castleberry, 2021)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Another major moral dilemma concerns the usage
of robots in low-skill  jobs. Such as manufacturing plants and mines. These
fields are in demand and also dangerous for people to work in. The reduction of
these jobs in these fields increases the necessity for higher education. For
members of society to find adequately paying jobs in an era where the cost of
living is being raised, where education, on the whole, is gatekept by
opportunity and/or monetary cost to the potential student. The impact of the
automation and loss of jobs such as these could lead to a greater amount of
people living in poverty. (DJ Wardynski, 2020) (Kenna Castleberry, 2021)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='background:yellow'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In conclusion, the advancements in robotics
will lead to a safer and possibly more efficient society, one where we would
also need to take on a greater range of challenges associated with the social
and moral implications of the rapid integration of robotic technologies in our
daily lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>What will the impact be on daily life for
you and your family?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>The field of robotics would greatly improve
the quality of life in many impactful ways. Developments in devices capable of
completing household and other domestic tasks will free up the time available
for families to reconnect and participate in recreational activities. The
impact on my career from the development and refining of robotics will have an
ever increasing influence, my current career path and my future career
planning. Although robotics can perform the function of making your coffee,
they lack the ability to have the human connection which I have with my
customers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One specific example is self-driving cars
which will impact commuting, as outsourcing the control of the car will allow
me to use the time more productively. Developments in autonomous vehicles will
remove limitations on who can operate them, providing greater accessibility for
the young, old and others who currently have limited access to personal
transportation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>With the advancement of robotics ideally more
of my time would be freed up to spend with my family and friends. Replacing
roles which are undesirable to the human workforce, and increasing the
available resources in areas where human intuition is required. This leads me
to believe that as a society we need to consider what aspects of our culture
and civilization we are willing to automate, and how to protect those displaced
by robotic innovations.</span></p>
