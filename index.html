									</div>
								</header>
								<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Peanuts-scaled.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Two of our membership are clearly defined leaders, with natural capacity to guide and direct the other members. These roles are essential in any team, to ensure outcomes are achieved, deadlines are adhered to and challenges confronted and overcome. There is always potential for strong personalities to come into conflict, especially when authoritative hierarchies are not well defined, however due to the limited group size, and the collective drive to accomplish the task, this should not present as a major issue.</p>

								<p>Two more of our membership present as critical thinkers and problem solvers. These traits are well suited to the challenges associated with developing and later implementing a totally new idea. The ability to analyse proposed ideas critically and dispassionately, then break down the tasks required to complete the chosen idea and tackle them bodes well for the outcome. With support from the leadership centric members to maintain focus and accountability these members will be valuable contributors.</p>

								<p>One of our members brings creativity, style and passion that will compliment the more logical and analytical members of the team. If this member can bring their ideas and personality to the forefront, they will add nuance and the immeasurable spark required to take this beyond merely technically proficient. It will require compassion and sensitivity from the more outgoing members of the team to allow this personality type to fully engage in the task at hand.</p>

								<p>The final member identifies as a mediator. The ability to manage the challenges that invariably arise in any team, to support the more passive members in achieving their potential, to assist the leaders in communicating, and to refocus the technical personalities onto the important items will be invaluable.</p>

									<h2>Assignment 3 - Group processes</h2>
									<p>How we worked completing assignment 3</p>
								</div>
							</header>

							<p>In assessment 2, our group the quality of our teamwork was mixed. We handled quality control, the completion of our own tasks for the assessment, and our last-minute rush to double and triple-check our work exceptionally. We also worked well at communicating exactly what was going on at any time with messaging apps like Signal and regular meetings on Microsoft teams that were attended by everybody. A large portion of our struggles came down to team members struggling with meeting deadlines in advance to make more time to fix up other aspects of the assessment leading to a much more packed last-minute rush to finish off the last few details. A large portion of the group members also struggled with the written work portion of the assessment and needed more help with getting their reports in line.</p>

							<p>For assessment 3, based upon learnings from the previous assignment, it was decided to target tasks at individual members strengths instead of attempting to divide the work evenly across the entire group. This division resulted in Joshua Douglas and Jack Bell taking responsibility for the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS components, Thomas Jeremiah and Cameron Aitken handling all written components, and Jack Northway and Rogelio (Kevin) Espinoza tackling Assessment 5, including the presentation and storyboard. A more defined leadership structure was also implemented, with each group proving feedback and progress to a management role throughout the process. As each component of the project was completed, or could not progress, the resources were reassigned to other areas. The result of these changes was significant, with greater levels of accountability ensuring deadlines were met, reducing the workload in the final days before submission.</p>

									<h2>Assignment 3 - Career plans</h2>
									<p>Team Charlies members current career aspirations.</p>
								</div>
							</header>

							<p>Within Team Charlie, there are four roles and career paths targeting software development and operational engineering roles. Of the other two, one is a support role and the other is in communications hardware deployment.</p>

							<p>Of the four common roles, there is a focus on low level technical skills required to develop and maintain IT systems. The fields vary significantly, with each role demanding a specialized set of skills, however while these skills are specialized, the underlying core skills of programming, problem solving and critical thinking are common.</p>
							
							<p>The security role requires a high level of knowledge in this domain, and the skill required asses the output of the development and engineering roles for potential weaknesses.</p>

							<p>The final role is unique within this group, being both an enlisted military position and a hardware specific role. This will require the ability to function withing the confines of the military command structure, and intimate knowledge of the function and operation of the available hardware.</p>

							<p>All six of the career paths chosen by the group focus on specialization over generalization, with advanced capabilities in specific areas of the IT industry essential. It is inferred that these roles will be within larger teams containing which will include specialists in other areas. Of the highest rated technical skills found in the burning glass data, the roles selected by Team Charlie do not require several including SAP, graphic design, website production, ITIL and Python. This highlights the need for individuals to carefully consider their career pathways to allow focus effort when acquiring and advancing technical skills. It is noted that all roles share common non-technical skill requirements in communication, teamwork, and leadership. These generalized skills will enable individuals to be effective contributors, both within their specialization and their professional lives more broadly.</p>

								<p>I am a 25, with highly functioning Asperger’s Syndrome that works as an all-rounder primarily as a barista and have done so for 7 years. In my spare time I tend to be on my laptop either reading random articles, watching videos, or playing games, and sometimes a combination of several. In group environments I like to focus on doing my own thing where possible but tend to step up when forced, either through a barrage of issues coming in that need to be handled, or through a need to micromanage my environment when stressed.</p>

								<p>30 born and raised in the greatest country that was formally a colony, Australia. I have been a member of the defence force since 2017. My role as Artillery observer is a very communication heavy role, we employ several different radios and communication hardware/software utilised for engaging targets with offensive support (artillery, mortars, Jets, attack helicopters and ship to shore fires). Prior to this I had a trade as a ceiling fixer. I have always enjoyed working with computers, so Information Technology has been a long-time hobby. I would now like to gain a formal qualification to enable a transition into the industry. Other than IT I am also an avid SCUBA diver; nudibranchs are my favourite sea life to photograph. </p>

								<p>I have lived in rural Australia my entire life, working in primary production and in trade and technical roles in heavy industry. My time outside of work is spent with my young family, enjoying the opportunities that country Australia offers, and embracing my passion for metal, wood, and electronics projects. I have spent the last 3 years deeply involved with the modernisation of the IT systems used in the field of non-destructive inspection. This experience has sparked my desire to learn and has given me the opportunity to be at the forefront of new and newly reimagined technologies. I am looking forward to developing better user experiences and finding greater value in the data acquired from them.  </p>

								<p>Hi, everyone. My name is Jack, and I live in regional Victoria. I currently work in the Fire Industry, testing and installation of Fire Alarm Equipment. This job allows me to travel Victoria exploring different areas and gives me an insight into many different industries such as Military bases, Nursing Homes, Hospitals, Factory's and even school camps. My experience with IT has many been a personal one, I love tinkering with stuff, changing things and upgrading stuff. The reason I have enrolled in this course, is I am wanting to continue learning, and I find Information Technology to be an interesting topic. </p>

								<p>I have lived in Australia my whole life. My current job is a machine operator in a meatworks. My experience in information technology is as a Tafe Qld student over last 2.5 years, studying cyber security and information communication technology. The reason I want to study IT at RMIT is because I want to work to a higher standard in the IT field. My passion for IT started when I was at school, frequently visiting the library to tinker with the computers and assist members of the staff with areas of IT.</p>
